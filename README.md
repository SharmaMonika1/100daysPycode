# 100 Days Python Code
 This is a Python Learning session where we understand python and implement it to create projects from beginner level to an advanced level. For Beginner level lessons we use Jupyter Notebook, replit to do smaller tasks and projects. Then we will be using PyCharm as oru IDE to work further during the course.
The lessons and projects resemble the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
" by Dr. Angela Yu from Udemy.
